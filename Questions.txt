2.What is lazyloading?             
        Lazy loading is a technique used in computer programming and web development to defer the loading of
certain resources until they are actually needed. The idea is to postpone the loading of non-essential
or secondary content, such as images, scripts, or other media, until the user interacts with the webpage
in a way that requires those resources.

The primary goal of lazy loading is to improve the initial page load time and overall performance of
a website. When a webpage loads, it can be resource-intensive if it has to fetch and render all the 
content at once. Lazy loading allows developers to prioritize the loading of essential content and then 
load additional elements as the user scrolls down the page or takes specific actions.

In the context of web development, lazy loading is commonly used for images. 
Instead of loading all the images on a page when it initially loads, images 
below the fold (i.e., not visible in the initial view) are loaded only when 
the user scrolls down to see them.
